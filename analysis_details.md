# Directional Persistence Analysis in Cell Migration: Mathematical Framework

## Abstract

This document provides the mathematical foundation for quantitative analysis of directional persistence in cell migration, implemented in the accompanying Python software. The methodology follows the framework established by Gorelik & Gautreau (2014), enabling unbiased analysis of cell trajectory data acquired from time-lapse microscopy. The software performs autocorrelation analysis on movement direction vectors, quantifying persistence across hierarchically organized experimental conditions. This Python implementation extends the original Excel-based approach to efficiently process high-density trajectory data from fluorescently labeled PIEZO1 proteins, which requires computational resources beyond the capabilities of spreadsheet macros.

## Introduction

This Python implementation significantly enhances the original Excel macro-based method described by Gorelik & Gautreau, enabling the analysis of complex datasets generated when tracking fluorescently labeled membrane proteins such as PIEZO1. The increased computational efficiency allows for processing thousands of trajectory points across multiple experimental conditions, which would be computationally prohibitive in spreadsheet-based environments.

## Mathematical Framework

### Direction Vectors and Normalization

For a cell trajectory with position vectors $\vec{r}(t)$ recorded at discrete time points $t$, the instantaneous direction of movement is captured by displacement vectors between consecutive positions:

$$\vec{v}(t) = \vec{r}(t+\Delta t) - \vec{r}(t)$$

where $\Delta t$ is the time interval between consecutive frames.

These displacement vectors are normalized to unit vectors, isolating directional information from speed:

$$\hat{v}(t) = \frac{\vec{v}(t)}{|\vec{v}(t)|}$$

### Directional Autocorrelation Function

The directional autocorrelation function $C(\tau)$ quantifies the degree to which a cell's direction of movement at time $t+\tau$ correlates with its direction at time $t$:

$$C(\tau) = \langle \hat{v}(t) \cdot \hat{v}(t+\tau) \rangle_t$$

where $\langle \cdot \rangle_t$ denotes averaging over all available time points $t$ for a given time lag $\tau$, and $\cdot$ represents the scalar product.

This function satisfies the following properties:
- $C(0) = 1$ (perfect correlation at zero time lag)
- $C(\tau) \to 0$ for purely random movement as $\tau$ increases
- The decay rate of $C(\tau)$ characterizes the persistence time scale

### Statistical Analysis

For each time lag $\tau$, the software computes:

1. The mean autocorrelation across all trajectory segments:
   $$\mu(\tau) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i(\tau)$$

2. The standard error of the mean (SEM):
   $$\text{SEM}(\tau) = \frac{\sigma(\tau)}{\sqrt{N}}$$

   where $\sigma(\tau)$ is the standard deviation of autocorrelation values and $N$ is the number of contributing vector pairs.

### Persistence Time Extraction

The persistence time $P$ can be extracted by fitting the autocorrelation function to an exponential decay model:

$$C(\tau) \approx e^{-\tau/P}$$

The persistence time $P$ represents the characteristic time scale over which a cell "remembers" its previous direction.

## Hierarchical Data Processing

The software implements a hierarchical approach to data analysis:

1. **Track level**: Individual cell trajectories are analyzed independently.
2. **File level**: Multiple trajectories from a single experiment are aggregated.
3. **Condition level**: Replicate experiments under identical conditions are combined.
4. **Experiment level**: Different experimental conditions are compared.

This hierarchical organization enables robust statistical analysis at each level, accommodating the nested structure typical of cell migration experiments.

## Applications in Cell Migration Analysis

Direction autocorrelation analysis provides quantitative metrics for comparing:

- Persistence between different cell types
- Effects of extracellular matrix composition
- Impact of pharmacological interventions
- Consequences of genetic modifications
- Influence of chemical gradients
- Dynamics of fluorescently labeled membrane proteins, particularly PIEZO1
- Lateral mobility and clustering behavior of mechanosensitive ion channels

The persistence time derived from this analysis serves as a sensitive indicator of the molecular mechanisms governing cell polarity, cytoskeletal dynamics, and membrane protein organization.

## Implementation

The software implements this mathematical framework as follows:

1. Trajectory segmentation to identify continuous cell paths
2. Vector calculation and normalization
3. Autocorrelation computation for specified time lags
4. Statistical aggregation at hierarchical levels
5. Visualization of autocorrelation decay curves

The Python implementation provides several advantages over the original Excel macro approach:

1. **Enhanced computational efficiency**: Processes high-density trajectory data from fluorescently labeled PIEZO1 proteins using vectorized operations and optimized algorithms
2. **Scalable analysis**: Handles thousands of trajectory points across multiple experimental conditions simultaneously
3. **Hierarchical data organization**: Automatically processes complex experimental designs with multiple conditions and replicates
4. **Advanced visualization**: Generates publication-quality figures with individual tracks and statistical indicators
5. **Batch processing**: Analyzes entire experimental datasets without manual intervention

These enhancements enable the analysis of membrane protein dynamics at temporal and spatial resolutions previously inaccessible with spreadsheet-based approaches.
